Code Stuff
- A real play model. I just wanted to be able to put stones on the board, so I put in a terrible hack
- Architecture. Yeh, this is a big one.
- Figure out if 'copy' or 'retain' is needed for all the properties of ParserBridge, because I'm pretty much stumped.
- Better logging functions. All logging should be off in release versions

UI Stuff
- Get UIScrollView to show the board all the way zoomed out at the start
- Draw labels on the grid
- Landscape mode
- Real Go boards are actually rectangular. We should update the grid to the dimensions of a real board
- Board theme coverflow
- Don't pick a new stone image every time. You can see the white stone images jump around every time you zoom

Art Stuff
- Go stone and board artwork. Sen:te doesn't want to share.
- Art for settings tabs
