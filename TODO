Code Stuff
- A real play model. I just wanted to be able to put stones on the board, so I put in a terrible hack
- Architecture. Yeh, this is a big one.

UI Stuff
- Get UIScrollView to show the board all the way zoomed out at the start
- Draw labels on the grid
- Landscape mode
- Real Go boards are actually rectangular. We should update the grid to the dimensions of a real board
- Board theme coverflow

Art Stuff
- Go stone and board artwork. Sen:te doesn't want to share.
- Art for settings tabs
