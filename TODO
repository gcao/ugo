- A real play model. I just wanted to be able to put stones on the board, so I put in a terrible hack
- Get UIScrollView to show the board all the way zoomed out at the start
- Make sure artwork is acceptable to use
- Draw labels on the grid
- Landscape mode
- Real Go boards are actually rectangular. We should update the grid to the dimensions of a real board
