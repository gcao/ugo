C[This game record and the comments are taken from Go World #100 \
(Winter 2003-04), an excellent English language go magazine. \
It is part of an article called "Original Moves".

The "original move" is Black 13.

Published in the April 19, 2004 edition of the American Go E-Journal.]

C[White 12 is an unusual approach move. White wants to stop Black \
from building a moyo; White 12 tries to strike a balance between \
attacking the right side and the group to the left. If Black \
makes the ordinary answer of X (Q5) or Y (P4), White will be \
happy to extend to Z (K4). Black came up with an answer that \
was unexpected but immediately convincing.

Where do you think Shuko will play?]

C[Striking at 13, a kind of shoulder hit, is a move that exemplifies \
the bold, original style of Fujisawa Shuko. White 12 had looked \
like an interesting idea, but Black 13 turned out to be so severe \
that Kobayashi commented that he should have played at X (O3).

In the game, Kobayashi took sente with 14 and 16 so that he could \
switch to the right side with 18.]

C[Instead of 21, Black could have played more aggressively by peeping \
at X (J5).]

C[Black was probably not completely satisfied when White moved \
out into the center up to 26. Even so, attacking with 27 secured \
a big right side territory, so Black had an easy game.]
